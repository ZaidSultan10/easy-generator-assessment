Respected Tech Dude :)

Below are the steps to start the client and the server

The client is on reactjs and server is on nestjs

once you download and open the folder you will first download the packages for client and server

easy-generator-client -> npm i
easy-generator-server -> npm i

to start the application we will proceed with the following commands

easy-generator-client -> npm start
easy-generator-server -> npm run start:dev

Please check server env for mongodb URI. I have kept mongodb ip as global so on any pc it should be accessible

For any further questions please reach out to zaidsultan09@gmail.com

Hope you like it. Ignore the UI.
